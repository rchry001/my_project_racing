# Welcome to The Speedracer!!!
# Happy you decided to come race with us!

# This program is all about entertainment. I wanted to create an experience anyone can
# pick up and play to distract yourself or to show your skills to impress your friends

# The game is easy - 3 simple rules:
# 1) Avoid the dangers on the road, including the zombie!
# 2) Stay within the screen by using the left and right arrows (use up and down sparingly)
# 3) Keep racing and beat your high score

# To run this app, the user will need to:
# Always ensure you are in the correct directory first!!! 
# Create a first time conda environment and then activate environment when needing to run program
# Install the package dependencies (pygame, python-dotenv)
# The program runs via pygame and is graphic intensive, the stronger the computer, the better

## This current conda enviroment is projectrandom-env

#### Added functionalities:
# Game intro
# Game buttons with interaction
# Background music and crash sound effect
# Moving Dangers on screen
# Moving zombie danger
# Pause feature
